## A local solution for scribit.design
I've been logged out of my scribit.design account for a while now, it seems like it's an issue for more people. While I'm not a developer myself nor an expert on hardware hacking, I just start this repo so people can **write issues** and get going with running the hardware o_ffline, locally, via USB or whatever is necessary_.
