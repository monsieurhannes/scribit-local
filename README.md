# scribit-local
## A local solution for scribit.design
I've been logged out of my scribit.design account for a while now, it seems like it's an issue for more people. While I'm not a developer myself nor an expert on hardware hacking, I just start this repo so people can **write issues** and get going with running the hardware _offline, locally, via USB or whatever is necessary_.

I'd say these options are the most likely:
- see if it's possible to have a locally running server in between the device and scribit's own server (which seems to have issues)
- open the device to get access to the PCB and upload designs via USB or similar

I don't know what format Scribit uses and how to reproduce it. Let's help each other to reduce e-waste of these expensive machines.
